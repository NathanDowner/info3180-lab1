  <h1>Nathan Downer</h1>
  <p>Have you ever wondered what your true calling in life was? I have too. currently I think it has something to do with building software lol. I find a lot of pleasure in seeing little projects come to life and make people's lives easier. Maybe that's because that's what God does for me, and I am an extension of him.</p>
  <p>I mean, technically we all are extensions of Him.</p>
